**给图像模型的 Prompt：**

"Visualize a personal website UI redesign. The content and layout structure should resemble the existing `fxzhong.github.io` website (blog posts, navigation, main content area, about section). However, the aesthetic must be transformed into a cutting-edge **iOS 26 skeumorphic glassmorphism style**.

Key elements to feature:
* **Background:** A subtle, blurred background (perhaps with soft gradients or abstract shapes), providing depth behind the glass elements.
* **Main Content Area & Cards:** All major sections (like individual blog post cards, the main content container, navigation bar) should appear as frosted glass or transparent acrylic panels.
* **Glassmorphism Effects:** Emphasize the frosted glass effect with a clear blur behind the panels, subtle light reflections, and soft, distinct shadows that create a sense of depth and layering.
* **Icons & Buttons:** Buttons and interactive elements should also have a glass-like texture, with subtle gradients and a press-down animation feel (even in a static image). Icons should be sleek and modern, possibly with a subtle inner shadow or light source to match the skeumorphic feel.
* **Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif fonts, ensuring readability against the semi-transparent backgrounds. Text might have a subtle "embossed" or slightly glossy effect.
* **Color Palette:** A clean, modern palette with soft pastels or desaturated colors, allowing the glass effects to be prominent. Avoid harsh, solid colors.
* **Overall Feel:** Luxurious, futuristic, clean, and highly interactive. The elements should feel tangible and layered, not flat.

Imagine how a personal blog/portfolio site would look if it were a native app in the most advanced iOS interface, combining the best of old-school skeuomorphism's tactility with modern glassmorphism's transparency."

**现在，让我们看看这个设计概念的视觉效果！**

That looks really cool! The image successfully captures the iOS-inspired glassmorphism style while retaining a blog-like structure.

Based on this visual, here's how you might approach implementing this on your GitHub Pages site, keeping in mind the original `fxzhong.github.io` structure:

### Implementation Approach for Your GitHub Pages Site:

This design fundamentally relies on **CSS** for its visual effects. You'll be heavily modifying or replacing the existing CSS of the Jekyll theme.

1.  **Understand the HTML Structure (from `fxzhong.github.io`):**
    * **Main Navigation:** The top bar with "首页", "班级", "交流", "推广", "与我" would be your `nav` element.
    * **Content Cards:** Each blog post summary (`<div class="post-item">` or similar) would become one of the glass cards.
    * **Sidebar/Widgets:** Elements like "均荟云" with buttons would be separate `<aside>` or `<div>` elements.
    * **Header/Footer:** The overall page container.

2.  **Core CSS for Glassmorphism:**

    * **`backdrop-filter: blur(XXpx);`**: This is the most crucial CSS property for the frosted glass effect. It applies graphical effects (like blur) to the area behind an element.
    * **`background-color: rgba(color, alpha);`**: Use semi-transparent background colors (e.g., `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` for a light glass).
    * **`border: 1px solid rgba(color, alpha);`**: A very subtle, lighter border can enhance the glass edge.
    * **`box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba(color, alpha);`**: For the soft shadows that give depth. Experiment with different values.
    * **`border-radius: XXpx;`**: Use generous `border-radius` values (as seen in the image) for the rounded corners.
    * **`transform: translateZ(0);` (or similar):** Sometimes helps with performance on some browsers when using `backdrop-filter`.

3.  **Styling Specific Elements:**

    * **Body/Background:** The `body` element should have the blurred background image or gradient (the darker, soft blue background in the image).
    * **Navigation Bar:** Apply the glassmorphism CSS to your `nav` element.
    * **Blog Post Cards:** Each `.post-item` (or whatever class your theme uses for blog post summaries) needs the glassmorphism styling.
    * **Buttons:** Style your buttons with the glass texture and rounded corners.
    * **Typography:** Ensure text colors are legible against the semi-transparent backgrounds. Use `font-weight` and `font-size` for hierarchy.

4.  **Jekyll Theme Integration:**

    * **Locate CSS Files:** In your forked `fxzhong.github.io` repository, look for the CSS files. They are typically in `assets/css` or similar. You might have `main.scss` or `style.css`.
    * **Override/Add Styles:** You can create a new CSS file and link it in your `_layouts/default.html` (or similar) *after* the original theme CSS, so your styles take precedence. Or, directly edit the existing CSS files.
    * **HTML Structure:** You might need to slightly adjust the HTML structure (e.g., wrap existing elements in new `div`s) in `_layouts`, `_includes`, or `index.html` to properly apply the glassmorphism to distinct "panels."
    * **`_config.yml`:** No direct changes here for CSS, but ensure your site's metadata is correct.

### Tips for Implementation:

* **Start Small:** Don't try to change everything at once. Start with one element, like a single blog post card, and get its glassmorphism effect right.
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (F12) extensively to inspect elements, test CSS changes live, and identify which CSS rules are affecting which parts of the page.
* **Fallback:** `backdrop-filter` is not supported in all browsers (though most modern ones do). Consider a solid or semi-transparent background as a fallback for unsupported browsers.
* **Responsiveness:** Remember to consider how your glass panels will look and behave on smaller screens (mobile devices). You might need media queries.
* **Colors:** Choose a background color for the body that contrasts well with your glass elements but isn't too distracting. The example image uses a great muted, blurred background.

This will be a fun project in CSS customization! Let me know if you want to dive into specific CSS properties or Jekyll file locations.
